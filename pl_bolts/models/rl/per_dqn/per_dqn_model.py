# Prioritized Experience Replay

The standard DQN uses a buffer to break up the correlation between experiences and uniform random samples for each
batch. Instead of just randomly sampling from the buffer prioritized experience replay (PER) prioritizes these samples
based on training loss. This concept was introduced in the paper
[Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)

Essentially we want to train more on the samples that suprise the agent.

The priority of each sample is defined below where

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P(i)=\frac{P^\alpha_i}{\sum_kP_k^\alpha}"/>

where pi is the priority of the ith sample in the buffer and
ùõº is the number that shows how much emphasis we give to the priority. If ùõº = 0 , our
sampling will become uniform as in the classic DQN method. Larger values for ùõº put
more stress on samples with higher priority

Its important that new samples are set to the highest priority so that they are sampled soon. This however introduces
bias to new samples in our dataset. In order to compensate for this bias, the value of the weight is defined as

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;w_i=(N . P(i))^{-\beta}"/>

Wher beta is a hyper parameter between 0-1. When beta is 1 the bias is fully compensated. However authors noted that
in practice it is better to start beta with a small value near 0 and slowly increase it to 1.

### Benefits

- The benefits of this technique are that the agent sees more samples that it struggled with and gets more
chances to improve upon it.

### PER Memory Buffer

First step is to replace the standard experience replay buffer with the prioritized experience replay buffer. This
is pretty large (100+ lines) so I wont go through it here. There are two buffers implemented. The first is a naive
list based buffer found in memory.PERBuffer and the second is more efficient buffer using a Sum Tree datastructure.

The list based version is simpler, but has a sample complexity of O(N). The Sum Tree in comparison has a complexity
of O(1) for sampling and O(logN) for updating priorities.

### Update loss function

The next thing we do is to use the sample weights that we get from PER. Add the following code to the end of the
loss function. This applies the weights of our sample to the batch loss. Then we return the mean loss and weighted loss
for each datum, with the addition of a small epsilon value.

````python

    # explicit MSE loss
    loss = (state_action_values - expected_state_action_values) ** 2

    # weighted MSE loss
    weighted_loss = batch_weights * loss

    # return the weighted_loss for the batch and the updated weighted loss for each datum in the batch
    return weighted_loss.mean(), (weighted_loss + 1e-5).data.cpu().numpy()

````

## Results

The results below show improved stability and faster performance growth.

### Pong

#### PER DQN

Similar to the other improvements, we see that PER improves the stability of the agents training and shows to converged
on an optimal policy faster.

#### DQN vs PER DQN

In comparison to the base DQN, the PER DQN does show improved stability and performance. As expected, the loss
of the PER DQN is siginificantly lower. This is the main objective of PER by focusing on experiences with high loss.

It is important to note that loss is not the only metric we should be looking at. Although the agent may have very
low loss during training, it may still perform poorly due to lack of exploration.
